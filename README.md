# Bit.Country Ambassador Program

On Bit.Country, you can tokenize your community by starting your own bit country with a virtual world of your theme, your DAO, community token, NFT minting and marketplace. Your fans will then have a chance to earn your tokens through various KPIs you set.



# Criteria

- Good understanding of Bit Country's vision, metaverse and NFT
- Experience of community engagement on social media & meetups
- Interested in growing & educating the community for bit country, web3 and metaverse.
- Committed to the program. Ideally owning a community already, but not a must.

# Benefits

- We will bootstrap your bit country from our treasury.
- Promote your bit country and NFTs.
- We will secure a spot for you in the official BC ambassador district! That is a special area on the network. You may get an NFT from us :-)
